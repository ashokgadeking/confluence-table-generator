|1|ReplicationSettings|Optional JSON settings for AWS DMS Serverless replications that are provisioned using this replication configuration. For example, see  Change processing tuning settings.|Json| |No| | |
|2|ResourceIdentifier|Optional unique value or name that you set for a given resource that can be used to construct an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that resource. For more information, see  Fine-grained access control using resource names and tags.|String| |Yes|Yes| |
|3|ReplicationConfigIdentifier|A unique identifier that you want to use to create a ReplicationConfigArn that is returned as part of the output from this action. You can then pass this output ReplicationConfigArn as the value of the ReplicationConfigArn option for other actions to identify both AWS DMS Serverless replications and replication configurations that you want those actions to operate on. For some actions, you can also use either this unique identifier or a corresponding ARN in action filters to identify the specific replication and replication configuration to operate on.|String| |No|Yes| |
|4|ComputeConfig|Configuration parameters for provisioning an AWS DMS Serverless replication.|[ComputeConfig|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-dms-replicationconfig-computeconfig.html]| |No|Sub-property may require GR| |
|5|ReplicationType|The type of AWS DMS Serverless replication to provision using this replication configuration.|String| |No| | |
|6|TableMappings|JSON table mappings for AWS DMS Serverless replications that are provisioned using this replication configuration. For more information, see   Specifying table selection and transformations rules using JSON.|Json| |Yes| | |
|7|SourceEndpointArn|The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source endpoint for this AWS DMS Serverless replication configuration.|String| |Yes|Yes| |
|8|SupplementalSettings|Optional JSON settings for specifying supplemental data. For more information, see  Specifying supplemental data for task settings.|Json| |No| | |
|9|TargetEndpointArn|The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target endpoint for this AWS DMS serverless replication configuration.|String| |Yes|Yes| |
|10|Tags|One or more optional tags associated with resources used by the AWS DMS Serverless replication.
